# Lost Temple Operators
Initial Project for Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms

## Introduction
This project involves creating an algorithm to determine the correct parenthesization of a sequence of binary operations (âŠ•) to achieve a desired result, given a custom operation table and input sequence. The output should indicate if this is possible and provide the leftmost parenthesization.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the program, use the following commands:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 -Wall file.cpp -lm
./a.out < teste.txt
```
